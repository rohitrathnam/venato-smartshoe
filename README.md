HL2032 - smart shoe project

## Problem
1. Conditioning coach: As a conditioning coach, I want to have deep analysis of foot pressure during exercises such as squats or deadlift.  Plus, I want to perform kinetic tests that requires Force plates and labs, anytime. maybe after a workout. Besides, jumping parameters, such as impact time, landing forces etc are really important in order to prevent injuries for me.
