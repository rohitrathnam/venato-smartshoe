# Venato Smart Shoe
HL2032 team project to create a smart shoe that measures pressure distribution and gait parameters of the feet. 

## Lean Canvas

### Problem
1. Conditioning coach: As a conditioning coach, I want to have deep analysis of foot pressure during exercises such as squats or deadlift.  Plus, I want to perform kinetic tests that requires Force plates and labs, anytime. maybe after a workout. Besides, jumping parameters, such as impact time, landing forces etc are really important in order to prevent injuries for me.
1. As a fitness user, I want track my fitness through step counts and visualise on my devices
1. As a senior care provider, I want the device to record foot pressure distributions to track posture and joint health
2. As a physiotherapist, I want to visualise the different gait parameters to assess posture and monitor corrections
3. As a user I want the device to be wireless for ease of use
